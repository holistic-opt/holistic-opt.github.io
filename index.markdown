## Holistic Optimization of Database-Backed Applications
An NSF-funded project on optimizing bigdata applications that utilize databases for 
persistent storage.

### Project Goals

From banking to online shopping, data-driven applications that comprise of a
database management system (DBMS) and an application that interacts with the
DBMS are pervasive in our daily lives and the scientific community. Needless to
say, the performance of data-driven applications is crucial. Unfortunately, due
to the quickly increasing data size and ever-changing operational environment
of the data center that host such applications, many data-driven applications
suffer from performance problems. Techniques and tools that can help identify
existing performance problems, predict future performance problems that will
arise with workload and operational environment changes, and fix these problems
in data-driven applications are highly desired in the current age of big data.

Unfortunately, although previous work in programming systems and database
research communities have studied performance problems and query execution-time
prediction, they are insufficient to address the performance problems that
arise in data-driven applications. For instance, prior work in programming
systems focus on optimizing applications, and treat the DBMS as a black box
with unknown performance characteristics. Meanwhile, research in the database
community focuses on analyzing query performance, and is oblivious to the fact
that many queries are programmatically generated by applications with
predictable structures.

### Research Challenges
In this project, we argue that such “black box” approach forgoes many
opportunities in identifying, and fixing performance problems in data-driven
applications. Our key insight is to regard the DBMS and the application as
white boxes and devise new opportunities to optimize both systems
simultaneously. First, we plan to use various program analysis techniques to
understand the semantics of data-driven applications. We will devise new
program analysis techniques to study the structure and sources of parameter
values for the queries that are issued by the application, the query plans that
the DBMS use to process such queries, and how the query results are
subsequently used by the application.  

Next, we will use such information to
identify performance problems in data-driven applications. Leveraging the
end-to-end performance modeling of the DBMS and the application in data-driven
applications, we will design new program analysis algorithms, performance
testing techniques, and performance debugging tools to identify workload and
code fragments in the application that might cause performance problems.

We will evaluate our techniques using real-world
data-driven applications such as web applications that store persistent data in
DBMSs.


### Broader Impacts
The project addresses one of the most important and fundamental challenges of
the big data era, namely the performance of data-driven applications. It will
broadly benefit other science disciplines and the society by improving the
performance of data-driven applications. We will leverage their expertise in in
database systems, program analysis, performance debugging, and software
engineering to tackle the challenges. Furthermore, we have extensive
connections with researchers and industry practitioners at Intel, Huawei,
Google, and Microsoft, and will make use of such connections to validate their
research findings.

We plan to release all software and benchmarks that are developed to public
domain. The techniques developed in this project will be incorporated into
graduate-level and undergraduate-level courses in data management systems and
programming systems offered at the University of Washington.
